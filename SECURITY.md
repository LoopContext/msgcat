# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied to the latest minor within the current major version. Critical fixes may be backported to the previous minor when practical (see [Support Policy](docs/SUPPORT.md)).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

To report a vulnerability:

1. Email the maintainers or open a private security advisory on GitHub if the repo supports it.
2. Include a clear description, steps to reproduce, and impact.
3. Allow reasonable time for a fix before any public disclosure.

We will acknowledge receipt and aim to respond with next steps promptly.
